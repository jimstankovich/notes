# About these notes {#sec-about}

R is a programming language used by many researchers to analyse data. The aims of these notes are:

-   to give you an understanding of how R works,
-   to help you appreciate why people find R useful for managing, analysing and plotting data, and
-   to encourage you to use R for your research.

These notes focus on the the use of R to manage and plot data. They not teach any statistics, though they include examples showing how to do t-tests and chi-square tests.

## Sources {#sec-sources}

These notes use data on countries around the world based on free material from [GAPMINDER.ORG](https://www.gapminder.org/data/), CC-BY LICENSE. Hans Rosling, the co-founder of Gapminder, has given some extremely impressive presentations using Gapminder data, for example [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo).

Some parts of these notes are taken directly from a longer course called [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/), and I have made some modifications. The course *R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis* is Copyright (c) [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). Here is the [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) governing the use of the course.

Half-way through writing these notes, I discovered an excellent online book, [R for Non-Programmers: A Guide for Social Scientists](https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/) by Daniel Dauber (2024). If I had found this book sooner, I would have included many more good ideas from it.

## How to use these notes

To work through the exercises in these notes, you need two pieces of software installed on your computer:

1.  `r em2("R")`, available [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/).
2.  `r em2("RStudio")`, available [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download).

Please make sure you have the latest versions installed. If you have any problems installing them, take a look at the instructions in Chapter 3 of [R for Non-Programmers](https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/setting-up-r-and-rstudio.html).

There is probably too much here to work through in 3 hours. If you are not very familiar with R, I'd recommend working though the following sections in order:

-   @sec-intro-R-RStudio: Introduction to R (work through Sections 2.3 to 2.12; come back and read Sections 2.1 and 2.2 later if you prefer)
-   @sec-loading-data: Loading data with the `readr` package
-   @sec-dplyr: Using the `dplyr` package to look at the `asean_data`

After that, if you have time, you can continue with

-   @sec-plotting: Plotting data with the `ggplot2` package

or you can jump to

-   @sec-stats: Some more statistical tests with the big Gapminder dataset

If you have your own data in a CSV file, try loading it as in @sec-loading-data.

Please take your time: try making some changes to the R commands here, and see what happens.

# Introduction to R and RStudio {#sec-intro-R-RStudio}

## Why use R and RStudio?

Research is a multi-step process: once you’ve designed an experiment and collected data, the real fun begins with analysis! In this section, we look at some of the fundamentals of the R language as well as some best practices for organizing code for research projects that will make your life easier.

Although we could use a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel or Google sheets to analyze our data, these tools are limited in their flexibility and accessibility. Critically, they also are difficult to share steps which explore and change the raw data, which is key to [“reproducible” research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285).

Therefore, these notes will help you begin exploring your data using R and RStudio. The R program is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, and is a freely-available where you downloaded it above. To run R, all you need is the R program.

However, to make using R easier, we will use the program RStudio, which we also downloaded above. RStudio is a free, open-source, Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It provides a built-in editor, works on all platforms (including on servers) and provides many advantages such as integration with version control and project management.

## A comparison of R and some other software

R was originally developed by statisticians, and many people use it for statistics: things like regression, hypothesis testing and calculating confidence intervals. There are various pieces of commercial statistical software that do these things, such as SPSS, Stata and SAS. Unlike these, R is free, open-source software. Thousands of people contribute to R by writing `r em2("packages")` (@sec-packages), and these packages do a wide range of useful things. In particular, they make it easier to organise, manage and tidy data, and to plot data. In some jobs I have used R to do these things without doing any statistics, and I think it does them better than other statistical software. Even if you are planning to do lots of statistical analyses, data is often messy, and it takes more time to organise and clean data than to analyse it. So don't underestimate the value of a system like R that is good for this!

Lots of people say that R takes *time* to learn: it will take you longer to work out how to do a t-test in R than in SPSS. In this *Nature* [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/517109a) from 2014, ecologist Megan Jennings says it is worth spending the time learning R:

> “Make that time. Set it aside as an investment: for saving time later, and for building skills that can be used across multiple problems we face as scientists.”

R is *not* designed for doing algebra and solving equations, or for plotting graphs. Other tools are better for these things, such as the commercial software Matlab and Mathematica and the free website [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).

## Overview

We will begin with raw data, perform exploratory analyses, and learn how to plot results graphically. This example starts with data from gapminder.org, containing yearly statistics for many countries through time. Can you read the data into R? Can you calculate the total population of ASEAN countries? Can you plot life expectancy for various countries? By the end of these lessons you will be able to do things like these in under a minute!

**Basic layout**

When you first open RStudio, you will see three panels:

-   The interactive R console/Terminal (entire left)
-   Environment/History/Connections (tabbed in upper right)
-   Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (tabbed in lower right)

![](images/RStudio_screenshot1.png)

Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open in the top left. You can start a new R script by going to the "File" menu, and choosing "New File", then "R script" (both of these choices are at the top).

![](images/RStudio_screenshot2.png)

::: callout-tip
## R Scripts

Any commands that you write in the R console can be saved to a file to be re-run again. Files containing R code to be ran in this way are called R scripts. R scripts have `.R` at the ends of their names to let you know what they are.
:::

## Workflow within RStudio

There are two main ways you can work in RStudio:

1.  Test and play within the interactive R console then copy code into a .R file to run later.

    -   This works well when doing small tests and initially starting off.
    -   It quickly becomes laborious

2.  Start writing in a .R file and use RStudio’s short cut keys for the Run command to push the current line, selected lines or modified lines to the interactive R console.

    -   This is a great way to start; all your code is saved for later
    -   You will be able to run the file you create from within RStudio or R's `source` function.

::: callout-tip
## Tip: Running Segments of Your Code

RStudio offers you several ways to run code from within the editor window. To run the current line, you can

```         
1. click on the Run button above the editor panel, or
2. select “Run Lines” from the “Code” menu, or
3. hit Ctrl+Return in Windows or Linux or ⌘+Return on OS X. 
```

To run several lines of code (instead of just one), select the lines first and then use one of these 3 methods.
:::

## Introduction to R

Much of your time in R will be spent in the R interactive console. This is where you will run all of your code, and can be a useful environment to try out ideas before adding them to an R script file.

The first thing you will see in the R interactive session is a bunch of information, followed by a “\>” and a blinking cursor. Here you type in commands, R tries to execute them, and then returns a result.

## Using R as a calculator

This is the simplest thing you can do with R.

If you type

`1 + 100`

in the console and press return, it shows the answer (101) with `[1]` in front of it:

`[1] 101`

We'll discuss the `[1]` later.

If you type an incomplete command, like

`3 -` (instead of `3 - 2` )

and press return, R will show a

`+`

to indicate that it is expecting something else. If you want to cancel a command you can hit Esc and RStudio will give you back the `>` prompt.

From now on in these notes, we'll show R commands and the results they give like this:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
1 + 100
```

with the R commands in a grey box and the results in a pale purple box. You can copy the R commands by hovering on the right edge of the grey box and clicking on the clipboard. Don't just read the commands... copy and paste them into RStudio, run them for yourself, try changing them, and see what happens!

When using R was a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you learned in school. Things are executed in this order:

-   Brackets `(`, `)`
-   Raise one number to the power of another number: `^` or `**` (can use either symbol)
-   Multiply `*` and divide `/`
-   Add `+` and subtract `-`

For example, compare the difference between

```{r}
#| class-output: output
3 + 5 * 2
```

and

```{r}
#| class-output: output
(3 + 5) * 2
```

Large and small numbers, for example the population of China in 2022 (1.43 billion), are written in scientific notation:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
1430000000
```

`e+09` is another way of writing for "multiplied by 10 to the power 9" (or `*10^9`), and 10 to the power 9 is one billion

```{r}
#| class-output: output
1.43 * 10^9
```

## Functions

R can also do other things you can do with a calculator. For example, to calculate the square-root of 36, type

```{r}
#| class-output: output
sqrt(36)
```

The command `sqrt` is known as a `r em2("function")`. R has many built in functions: some do maths like `sqrt`, and some do other things. To call a function, type its name, followed by opening and closing brackets. Some functions take `r em2("arguments")` as inputs (things typed inside the brackets). For example `sqrt` takes a single number as an argument (36 in the example above), and calculates its square root.

Some functions don't take any arguments:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
getRversion() # Check what version of R you are using
```

```{r}
#| class-output: output
getwd() # Check which folder any files will be written in if you decide to save something
```

(Here we have added *comments* to help explain our R commands. Anything on a line after a `#` is ignored by R, so it is a good place to write comments.)

Other functions take different types of arguments, for example

```{r}
#| class-output: output
paste0(1," dog"," and ","1","2", " cats")
```

This example shows that R works with text as well as numbers. The quotation marks `"` are used to show that the thing inside is text, not something else like a number, a function, or an object (@sec-object).

Don’t worry about trying to remember every function in R. You can look them up on Google, or if you can remember the start of the function’s name, type it and RStudio will provide some suggestions for the end of the name. For example, if you type `sq`, RStudio will list various functions starting with "sq", including `sqrt()`.

Typing a ? before the name of a command will open the *help page* for the command on the bottom right. The help page includes a detailed description of the command and how it works. The bottom of the help page will usually has examples of how to use the command. (This is often the most useful part of the help page!)

## Objects: giving names to pieces of information {#sec-object}

A key concept in R, and in any programming language, is to give names to pieces of data. You can give names to single numbers, a bit like `x`'s and `y`'s in algebra you did in high school, or to huge tables of data. Any name (like `x` or `y`) with something assigned to it is called an `r em2("object")`.

The `->` symbol is used to assign some data to an object. For example, the command

```{r}
#| class-output: output
x <- 9
```

creates an object called `x`, and sets `x` equal to 9.

To check what value an object has, just type the name of the object:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
x
```

Once `x` has been assigned a value, we can use it for calculations:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
x + 3
sqrt(x)
x^2 + 2*x + 1
(x+1)^2
```

You can also assign a new value to `x`

```{r}
#| class-output: output
x <- 42
x
```

Note that the command `x <- 42` changes the value of `x`, but it doesn't show us what the new value of `x` is. The `x` on the line below asks R to show us the value of `x`.

You can also change the value of `x` based on what its previous value was:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
x <- x + 1
x
```

To interpret the command `x <- x + 1`, start on the right. `x + 1` means take the current value of `x` (42) and add 1 to it (43). The arrow pointing to the left says: take the new value you calculated on the right (43) and assign it to the thing on the left (`x`).

If you prefer, you can use longer names for objects that are more informative than `x`, such as

```{r}
#| class-output: output
population_of_thailand_2022 <- 71.7 * 10^6
```

```{r}
#| class-output: output
thailandPop22 <- 71.7 * 10^6
```

These names can only include letters, numbers, `_`, and `.`, and names must start with a letter. So the following names are invalid:

-   `22pop` (cannot start with numbers)
-   `thailand pop` (cannot have spaces)
-   `pop-22` (cannot have a `-`)

If you use long names, you don't have to type them in full every time. Once RStudio knows that you have created an object called `population_of_thailand_2022`, it will suggest the full name after you type the first few characters.

## Exercise

What are the values of `mass` and `age` after the following commands are run?

```{r}
#| class-output: output
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## Click to see the solution

```{r}
#| class-output: output
mass <- 47.5
```

This gives the object `mass` a value of 47.5.

```{r}
#| class-output: output
age <- 122
```

This gives the object `mass` a value of 122.

```{r}
#| class-output: output
mass <- mass * 2.3
```

This takes the existing value of `mass` (47.5) and multiplies it by 2.3 to give it a new value of 109.25.

```{r}
#| class-output: output
age <- age - 20
```

This will subtract 20 from the existing value of 122 to give `age` a new value of 102.
:::

Objects can store other types of information, not just numbers. For example, they can store text:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
name_of_country <- "Thailand"
```

Objects can also store more than one piece of information, not just a single number or a single piece of text. Two of the most important types of objects in R with multiple pieces of information are `r em2("vectors")` and `r em2("data.frames")`.

## Vectors

A `r em2("vector")` is an object containing a list of things, where everything in list has the same basic data type. For example, everything in the vector can be a piece of text, or everything can be a number.

We can create vectors by using the R function `c()`, which "combines" or "concatenates" pieces of information. For example, here is a command to create a vector with 10 pieces of information: the names of the 10 ASEAN countries

```{r}
#| class-output: output
ASEAN_countries <- c("Brunei","Cambodia","Indonesia",
                     "Lao","Myanmar","Malaysia","Philippines",
                     "Singapore","Thailand","Vietnam")
ASEAN_countries
```

```{r}
#| class-output: output
numbers_less_than_10 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
numbers_less_than_10
```

```{r}
#| class-output: output
claims_made_by_Australian_politician <- c(F,F,F,T,F)
claims_made_by_Australian_politician
```

Note that you can use F and T as abbreviations for FALSE and TRUE.

R has special notation (`:`) to make lists of consecutive numbers:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
numbers_less_than_10 <- 1:9
numbers_less_than_10
```

Note the `[6]` in the vector `ASEAN_countries`. This indicates that `"Malaysia"` is the 6th element of the vector (and `[1]` indicates that `"Brunei"` is the 1st element of the vector). We can use square brackets to refer to individual elements of vectors

```{r}
#| class-output: output
ASEAN_countries[6]
ASEAN_countries[3]
```

or subsets of vectors

```{r}
#| class-output: output
countries_sharing_borders_with_Thailand <- ASEAN_countries[c(2,4:6)]
countries_sharing_borders_with_Thailand
countries_on_Mekong_River <- ASEAN_countries[c(2,4,5,9,10)]
countries_on_Mekong_River
```

Some numerical operations can be applied to vectors of numbers, just as they are applied to individual numbers:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
numbers_less_than_10 + 3
even_numbers <- numbers_less_than_10 * 2
even_numbers
square_numbers <- numbers_less_than_10 * numbers_less_than_10
square_numbers
```

## Joining vectors of the same length to make a `data.frame`

If we have 2 or more vectors of the same length, we can join them to make a table of data with multiple columns, one vector in each column, like something you might enter into a spreadsheet. In R, a table of data is called a `r em2("data.frame")`. To make a `data.frame`, lets combine our vector `ASEAN_countries` with a vector of [national dishes](https://aseanzone.wordpress.com/cultural/136-2/):

```{r}
#| class-output: output
national_dish <- c("ambuyat", "amok", "gado-gado", "chicken soup", "lahpet", "nasi lemak", "adobo", "laksa", "tom yum goong", "nem")
national_dish
```

We can double-check that the two vectors `ASEAN_countries` and `national_dish` have the same length, using a function called `length()`:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
length(ASEAN_countries)
length(national_dish)
```

and join the vectors together to make a `data.frame`, which we'll call `ASEAN_info`:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
ASEAN_info <- data.frame(ASEAN_countries, national_dish)
ASEAN_info
```

I would prefer to call the first column (or vector) `country` instead of `ASEAN_countries`. So let's change the name of this column using R's `colnames()` function:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
colnames(ASEAN_info)
colnames(ASEAN_info)[1] <- "country"
ASEAN_info
```

We can select individual vectors in our data.frame by writing the vector's name after the name of the data.frame, separated by `$`:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
ASEAN_info$country
ASEAN_info$national_dish
```

## Checking whether statements are TRUE or FALSE

R can check whether particular statements are TRUE or FALSE. This is very useful for selecting rows of large data.frames meeting particular conditions.

For example, we can check whether

```{r}
#| class-output: output
5 > 4
```

or

```{r}
#| class-output: output
sqrt(49) < 7
```

As well as the comparisons "greater than" (`>`) and "less than" (`<`), we can also make the comparisons

-   `>=` (greater than or equal to)
-   `<=` (less than or equal to)
-   `==` (equal to)
-   `!=` (not equal to)

These comparisons can be applied to vectors as well as individual variables. The comparisons `==` (equal to) and `!=` (not equal to) can also be applied to text as well as numbers.

For example

```{r}
#| class-output: output
y <- ASEAN_countries != "Singapore"
z <- ASEAN_countries == "Vietnam"
data.frame(ASEAN_info, y, z)

over50 <- square_numbers > 50
data.frame(square_numbers, over50)
```

Another useful option of checking whether something is TRUE or FALSE is to use the operator `%in%`. You can use this to check whether a particular value is in a vector, or which elements of one vector are in another vector. For example

```{r}
#| class-output: output
"Brunei" %in% ASEAN_countries
"East Timor" %in% ASEAN_countries
is_square_number <- numbers_less_than_10 %in% square_numbers
data.frame(numbers_less_than_10, is_square_number)
```

We can use `%in%` to add a column to our `ASEAN_info` data.frame, showing which ASEAN countries the Mekong River runs through:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
on_Mekong_River <- ASEAN_countries %in% countries_on_Mekong_River
ASEAN_info <- data.frame(ASEAN_info, on_Mekong_River)
ASEAN_info
```

## R packages {#sec-packages}

It is possible to add functions to R by writing a `r em2("package")`, or by obtaining a package written by someone else. Packages are sometimes also called `r em2("libraries")`. There are over 10,000 packages in a public collection called CRAN (the comprehensive R archive network). R and RStudio have functionality for managing packages:

-   You can see what packages are installed by typing `installed.packages()`
-   You can install packages by typing `install.packages("packagename")`, where `packagename` is the package name, in quotes.
-   You can update installed packages by typing `update.packages()`
-   You can remove a package with `remove.packages("packagename")`
-   You can make a package available for use with `library(packagename)`

Packages can also be viewed, loaded, and detached in the Packages tab of the lower right panel in RStudio. Clicking on this tab will display all of the installed packages with a checkbox next to them. If the box next to a package name is checked, the package is loaded and if it is empty, the package is not loaded. Click an empty box to load that package and click a checked box to detach that package.

Packages can be installed and updated from the Package tab with the Install and Update buttons at the top of the tab.

Below we will discuss 3 packages with some very useful functions:

-   `readr` for loading datasets into R from spreadsheets and CSV files,
-   `dplyr` for managing datasets, and
-   `ggplot2` for making graphs.

But before we can use these packages, we need to install them.

::: {.callout-caution appearance="minimal"}
## Exercise

Install the packages `dplyr`, `readr`and `ggplot2`.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal" collapse="true"}
## Click to see the solution

We can use the `install.packages()` command to install the required packages.

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("readr")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
:::

As well as adding functions to R, many packages include interesting datasets to play with. For example:

-   The package [nycflights](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nycflights13) includes data for all flights that departed from New York City in 2013.

-   The package [gapminder](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gapminder) includes an older version of the Gapminder data that we use in these notes (up to 2007).

-   The book [R for Non-Programmers](https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/) has a companion package `r4np` with all the datasets used in the book. This package is not yet available in CRAN, so you need to follow slightly different instructions to install it. The instructions are included in the book [here](https://bookdown.org/daniel_dauber_io/r4np_book/r-basics-the-very-fundamentals.html#installing-packages-using-a-function).

There is huge list of packages with datasets at <https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html>.

# Working with data

## Loading data with the `readr` package {#sec-loading-data}

Let's load a small CSV file with some Gapminder data for 10 ASEAN countries. We will use the package `readr` to do this.

I have put the CSV file on a webpage [here](https://github.com/jimstankovich/notes/blob/main/data/asean_data.csv).

There are two ways you can load the data into R. You can either download it onto your computer first (Method 1), or you can load it into R directly from the website (Method 2).

### Method 1: Download the data onto your computer, then load it from your computer into R

-   Go to the URL (website) above.

-   Hover on the little arrow pointing down on the right. The words "Download raw file" will appear in a black box. ![](images/Github_screenshot.png)

-   Click on this arrow to download the CSV file.

-   Find where the file was downloaded on your computer, and move it to a folder where you want to keep it.

-   In the "Files" window of RStudio (bottom right), navigate to the folder where you put the data, select the file, and choose "Import Dataset..." ![](images/find_the_data_in_RStudio.png)

-   A new window appears, giving you some options to control how you open the file. In this case the default settings are fine... you don't need to change anything. So just click "Import" on the bottom right to load the data. Note that the 3 R commands which will be run appear in a box on the bottom right. ![](images/data_loading_options.png)

-   These 3 commands run in the Console window on the bottom left. The folder in the second line will be different on your computer (not the same as `"~/Documents/Research Methodology in Social Sciences/introduction_to_R/data/"`), depending on where you put the file `asean_2022_data.csv`.

-   Copy these 3 commands to your .R file so you can run them automatically next time, without having to open windows and click in them. This makes your analysis more "reproducible".

Let's look at the 3 commands and what they do:

1.  `library(readr)`: The `library()` function makes the package `readr` available for use (as mentioned in @sec-packages above).

2.  `asean_data <- read_csv("[path_to_folder]/asean_data.csv")`: The function `read_csv` is part of the `readr` package. Here it reads the CSV file `asean_data.csv` into R's memory and gives it the name `asean_data`. (We could call it something else if we wanted to.) Some information appears in the Console window about the data. The `country` column has text information (character or "chr" for short). The other 4 columns (`year`, `pop`, `lifeExp`, `gdpPercap`) have numerical information (stored as "double-precision" numbers, or "dbl" for short... don't worry about this computer science terminology if you haven't heard it before).

![](images/description_of_data_that_was_loaded.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

3.  `View(asean_data)`: This command opens a spreadsheet-style view of the data on the top-left. If you close this window the data is stored in R... it is just a "view" of the data.

![](images/data_View.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

When you load the data, `asean_data` also appears in the "Environment" window on the top-right. If you click the little blue arrow, it provides some information on the variables in the data:

![](images/environment.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}

In summary, 3 of the 4 windows in RStudio are showing similar information about the data we have just loaded. :) It is up to you to decide which way(s) of looking at the data are most helpful.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(readr)
asean_data <- read_csv("~/Documents/Research Methodology in Social Sciences/introduction_to_R/data/asean_data.csv")
```

Yet another way to look at the data is to type the name of the dataset in the Console window:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_data
```

::: {.callout-caution appearance="minimal"}
## Exercise

If you have your own data in a CSV file, trying loading it using the `read_csv()` command. Then try adapting some of the commands below to apply them to your data.
:::

### Method 2: Download the data directly into R from the internet

Starting at the same URL as before (`https://github.com/jimstankovich/notes/blob/main/data/asean_data.csv`), click on the word "Raw" on the top right. This takes you take another webpage with the "raw" (unformatted) CSV data. You can use the `read_csv` command to load the data from this webpage:

```{r}
#| output: false
library(readr)
asean_data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimstankovich/notes/main/data/asean_data.csv")
```

Method 2 is fine for the small dataset we are looking at here. However, if you are running your R commands many times and working with a large dataset, it is better to download the dataset onto your computer first (Method 1), rather than downloading a large dataset many times.

## Using the `dplyr` package to look at the `asean_data` {#sec-dplyr}

I use the `dplyr` package more than any other packages. It is very useful for managing datasets: cleaning them, joining them, and selecting smaller sections for statistical analysis.

Let's look at how a few `dplyr` functions can be applied to the `asean_data`.

### Calculate the total population of the ASEAN countries

Suppose we want to know the total population of the 10 ASEAN countries in 2022. We can do this by adding up the values of `pop` in the rows from 2022. Let's do this in 2 steps:

1.  Create a smaller dataset that only includes rows with 2022 data.
2.  Add up the values in the column/vector `pop`.

#### Step 1

`dplyr` has a command called `filter()` for selecting particular rows of a dataset. The `filter()` command takes two arguments

-   the name of a data.frame
-   a condition to satisfy: only include rows where this condition is TRUE

```{r}
#| class-output: output
#| warning: false
library(dplyr)
asean_2022 <- filter(asean_data, year == 2022)
asean_2022
```

Many `dplyr` functions take the name of a data.frame as the first argument. There is an alternative notation for running these functions, where you put the name of the data.frame before the function, then join it to the function using the symbol `%>%`

```{r}
#| class-output: output
library(dplyr)
asean_2022 <- asean_data %>%
  filter(year == 2022)
asean_2022
```

I think this notation makes it clearer that we are starting with the `asean_data` data.frame, then applying the `filter()` function to make changes to it and produce `asean_2022`.

The `%>%` notation is particularly good when you want to apply several functions to a data.frame. Below are two pieces of code that do the same thing... which do you think is easier to read?

```{r}
#| class-output: output
large_wealthy_country <- 
  filter(filter(filter(asean_data, year == 2022), 
         gdpPercap > 20000), pop > 10e6)  # 10e6 is 10 million 
large_wealthy_country
```

```{r}
#| class-output: output
large_wealthy_country <- asean_data %>%
  filter(year == 2022) %>%
  filter(gdpPercap > 20000) %>%
  filter(pop > 10e6)  # 10e6 is 10 million
large_wealthy_country
```

#### Step 2

Now we can use the `sum()` function to add up the values of `pop` in `asean_2022`:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_pop_2022 <- sum(asean_2022$pop)
asean_pop_2022
```

So the total population of the ASEAN countries in 2022 was nearly 681 million. The function `sum()` is part of "base R"... you don't need to load `dplyr` to use it.

::: {.callout-caution appearance="minimal"}
## Exercise

Use the `filter()` function twice to select the row of `asean_data` containing 2012 statistics for the Philippines.

#| class-output: output

```

## Exercise

In 2012, what was the combined population of the 5 ASEAN countries that the Mekong River flows through?

#| class-output: output

mekong_countries_2012 <- asean_data %>%
  filter(year == 2012) %>%
  filter(country %in% countries_on_Mekong_River)
mekong_countries_2012
sum(mekong_countries_2012$pop)
```
:::

### Calculate average GDP per person

Suppose we want to calculate the average GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per person, averaged across all 681 million people living in ASEAN countries. The GDP figures in this dataset are in 2017 (inflation-adjusted) US dollars at [purchasing power parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity).

Here are the steps for calculating average GDP:

-   calculate the total GDP for each country
-   add up total GDP across countries
-   divide total ASEAN GDP by the ASEAN population

Total GDP for each country is equal to the country's population multiplied by GDP per person (per capita). Let's add a `total_gdp` column to the `asean_2022` data.frame using a `dplyr` command called `mutate()`:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_2022 <- asean_2022 %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
asean_2022
```

Then we can add up `total_gdp` across countries using the `sum()` function again:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_gdp_2022 = sum(asean_2022$gdp)
asean_gdp_2022
```

and calculate

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_gdp_per_capita_2022 <- asean_gdp_2022 / asean_pop_2022
asean_gdp_per_capita_2022
```

Here is some `dplyr` code that starts with our original CSV file (`asean_data`), and generates a summary of the 2022 population and GDP statistics for the whole of ASEAN.

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_2022_summary <- asean_data %>%
  filter(year == 2022) %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>%
  summarise(
    pop = sum(pop),
    total_gdp = sum(gdp),
    gdpPercap = total_gdp / pop)
asean_2022_summary
```

It uses `filter()` and `mutate()` in the same way we've seen before. There is also a new command `summarise()`.

If we wanted these statistics for both 2012 and 2022, we could remove the `filter()` function, keep data for both year, and instead apply another function `group_by()` before `summarise()`, to generate summaries for both years at the same time.

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_gdp_summary <- asean_data %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    pop = sum(pop),
    total_gdp = sum(gdp),
    gdpPercap = total_gdp / pop)
asean_gdp_summary
```

I don't think the `total_gdp` column is very useful... trillions of dollars seem to big to understand. We can select columns to keep using another `dplyr` command, `select()`:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_gdp_summary %>%
  select(year, pop, gdpPercap)
```

Or we can exclude particular columns by putting a `-` in front of their names:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_gdp_summary %>%
  select(-total_gdp)
```

### List of `dplyr` functions we have used

-   `filter()`: for selecting particular rows of a data.frame
-   `mutate()`: for adding a new column (vector) to a data.frame, or to change an existing column
-   `summarise()`: to calculate things like sums or averages across multiple rows
-   `group_by()`: I don't properly understand all the ways this function is used, but I often use it before `summarise()`, to calculate summaries by groups (e.g. for different years in the example above)

There is a useful summary of `dplyr` commands on this [Data Wrangling Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf).

## Plotting data with the `ggplot2` package {#sec-plotting}

I haven't used `ggplot2` much: I usually plot graphs using "base R" (without using any packages). However, many people recommend `ggplot2` for graphs, so I am trying it out. I don't yet understand the ["grammar of graphics"](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) used in `ggplot2`, so I'm definitely not qualified to teach anyone how to use it! Nevertheless, I'm still including this section to

-   give a bit of a flavour of how `ggplot2` commands look, and
-   help persuade you that graphs can be a very useful tool for helping communicate your research findings.

I did a lot of googling to make the graphs below. I have included links to some pages that helped.

I was impressed how fast it was to make some fairly complicated graphs with `ggplot2`, so I think I'll start using it more to explore data. I really like base R for fine-tuning graphs and converting them to pdf files for publications, so I may keep using base R for that.

### Bar graphs (and paired t-tests)

```{r}
#| class-output: output
library(ggplot2)

#https://r-graph-gallery.com/218-basic-barplots-with-ggplot2.html
#http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-title-main-axis-and-legend-titles
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15629192/making-a-bar-chart-in-ggplot-with-vertical-labels-in-x-axis
#https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/09/adding-text-labels-to-ggplot2-bar-chart/

ggplot(asean_2022, aes(x=country, y=lifeExp)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "dodgerblue3", stat = "identity") +
  ylab("Life expectancy at birth (2022)") +
  geom_text(aes(label = lifeExp, vjust = 1.2)) + 
  theme_light() + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))

```

```{r}
#| class-output: output

#https://rpubs.com/dvdunne/ggplot_two_bars

ggplot(asean_data, aes(x=country, y=lifeExp, fill=year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  ylab("Life expectancy at birth") +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))

```

This is not what we want! Year is being treated as a continuous variable, ranging in value from 2012 to 2022. We can fix this by converting year to a categorical variable (called a factor in R).

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_data <- asean_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(year))
ggplot(asean_data, aes(x=country, y=lifeExp, fill=year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  ylab("Life expectancy at birth") +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5))
```

Let's calculate change in life expectancy between 2012 and 2022 for each country. To do this, let's make a table that has one row for each country, and separate columns for life expectancy in 2012 (`le2012`) and 2022 (`le2022`). We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()` again.

```{r}
#| class-output: output
life_exp_table <- asean_data %>%
  arrange(year) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(
    le2012 = first(lifeExp),
    le2022 = last(lifeExp),
    le_change = le2022 - le2012,
    pop2022 = last(pop))

life_exp_table
```

There are some other `dplyr` function in here that we haven't seen before:

-   `arrange(year)` sorts the table by year, so that the 2012 data appears before the 2022 data

-   Once the data is grouped by `country`, the function `first()` is used to select the first life expectancy value for the country (the one for 2012), and the function `last()` is used to select the last life expectancy and population for the country (from 2022)

We can make a bar-graph to show the changes in life expectancy for each country:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(life_exp_table, aes(x=country, y=le_change)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "dodgerblue3", stat = "identity") +
  ylab("change in life expectancy (years), 2012 -> 2022") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(le_change,1), vjust = -1)) + 
  theme_light() + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1,vjust=0.5)) +
  #https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/lims.html
  ylim(-1, 4.5)
```

We can also do a paired t-test, to test the hypothesis that average life expectancy has increased from 2012 to 2022 across the 10 ASEAN countries. Here are 3 methods to do this test: they all give the same result.

#### Method 1: Compare life expectancies in 2022 and 2012 using the `t.test()` function

```{r}
#| class-output: output
t.test(life_exp_table$le2022, life_exp_table$le2012, paired = T)
```

#### Method 2: Look at changes in life expectancy

```{r}
#| class-output: output
t.test(life_exp_table$le_change)
```

#### Method 3: run a simple linear regression model with the `lm()` function

```{r}
#| class-output: output
regression_model <- lm(le_change ~ 1, data = life_exp_table)
summary(regression_model)
```

`lm()` is the R function to linear regression. The paired t-test is equivalent to a simple linear regression model, with only a constant term in the model.

#### Alternative method: give greater weight to larger countries

The paired t-test above treats all 10 countries equally. In some contexts, it might be more appropriate to give greater weight to the countries with larger populations:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
weighted_regression_model <- lm(le_change ~ 1, weights = pop2022, 
                                data = life_exp_table)
summary(weighted_regression_model)
```

### Line graphs showing changes in a variable over time {#sec-line-graphs}

To plot the graphs from now on, you need to download a much bigger CSV file of Gapminder data, called `big_gapminder_dataset.csv`. It is available [here](https://github.com/jimstankovich/notes/blob/main/data/big_gapminder_dataset.csv).

```{r}
#| class-output: output
#| warning: false

# Change the folder below to point to the data you downloaded.
big_gapminder_dataset <- read_csv("~/Documents/Research Methodology in Social Sciences/introduction_to_R/data/big_gapminder_dataset.csv",
        show_col_types = FALSE)

lifeExp_since_1900 <- big_gapminder_dataset %>% 
  filter(year >= 1900 & year <= 2022) %>%
  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp) %>%
  mutate(asean = country %in% ASEAN_countries)

asean_lifexp_since_1900 <- lifeExp_since_1900 %>%
  filter(asean == TRUE)

other_countries <- lifeExp_since_1900 %>%
  filter(asean == FALSE)

# This palette was recommended for people who are colour-blind

  ylab("life expectancy at birth, 2022") +
  theme_light()
```

### Bubble charts

(Scatterplots with different-sized circles for different points)

```{r}

  theme_light() +
  #https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/how-to-remove-legend-from-a-ggplot/
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Make a rough match of the plot at <https://www.gapminder.org/tools/>:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
#| warning: false

world_2022 <- big_gapminder_dataset %>%
  filter(year == "2022") %>%
  filter(country != "Monaco") %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop))

# Monaco has a very high GDP per capita, and it doesn't appear in the plot
# at https://www.gapminder.org/tools/. 
# So remove the data for Monaco with the != (not equal to) operator.

# arrange(desc(pop)) arranges the countries in order from largest population
# to smallest population. This means that the circles get plotted in order 
# from largest to smallest, so the larger circles don't hide smaller circles.

world_2022 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size=pop, col=continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  scale_size(range = c(.1, 24), name="Population") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log10') +
  guides(size = "none") + 
  theme_light() +
  xlab("GDP per capita, 2022 (purchasing power parity, 2017 US dollars)") +
  ylab("life expectancy at birth, 2022")
```

There are a lot of circles here, and we can't tell which plot is which. It would be nice to reproduce the feature of the plot at the [website](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/) above, which shows the name of each country each circle represents when you "hover" the mouse over it. It is possible to do this with another R package called `plotly`. You'll need to install it before running the code below.

```{r}
#| class-output: output
#| warning: false

library(plotly)

continent_colours <- data.frame(
  continent = c("Africa", "Americas", "Asia", "Europe"),
  colour = c("rgba(95,210,230,1)", "rgba(154,231,71,1)",
             "rgba(237,100,117,1)", "rgba(251,230,77,1)")
)
# This command makes a small data.frame assigning colours to continents.

# Plotly doesn't handle rows with missing data in the same way as ggplot2,
# so include a command to remove rows with missing data.

# is.na() tests whether the thing in brackets is missing.
# ! means "not". So !is.na() tests whether something is not missing.
# & means "and". So the command
#   filter(!is.na(lifeExp) & !is.na(gdpPercap) & !is.na(pop))
# means: just keep the rows where 
#    lifeExp is not missing, AND
#    gdpPercap is not missing, AND
#    pop is not missing.
world_2022v2 <- world_2022 %>%
  filter(!is.na(lifeExp) & !is.na(gdpPercap) & !is.na(pop)) %>%
  left_join(continent_colours, by = "continent")
# left_join() is another dplyr function. It adds information from
# the small continent_colours table we just made to the world_2022
# table. The two tables are matched using values of "continent".
# This adds a column of colours to the world_2022 table, used for
# plotting below. So the dplyr cheatsheet mentioned above 
# (https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) 
# for a nice illustration of how left_join() works.

fig <- plot_ly(world_2022v2, x = ~gdpPercap, y = ~lifeExp, text = ~country,
               type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
               marker = list(size = ~(sqrt((pop)/300000)+0.2), 
                             opacity = 0.8, color = ~colour))

## Some more statistical tests with the big Gapminder dataset {#sec-stats}

To work through this section, you need to run the first two R commands in @sec-line-graphs to create the data frames `big_gapminder_dataset` and `lifeExp_since_1900`.

### Unpaired t-test

In this [talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen/transcript?subtitle=en) given in 2006, Hans Rosling argues that undergraduate students in Sweden had "preconceived ideas" about global health. They mistakenly thought that there were very big differences in life expectancy between the "Western world" and rest of the world. Rosling shows that, while there was some truth to this in the 1960s, it was no longer the case in the 2006 (and is no longer the case now).

Let's look at this with the Gapminder dataset: use unpaired t-tests to compare life expectancy in 1962 and 2022 between the ASEAN countries and the 10 biggest European countries (countries with population greater than 18 million in 2022).

#### Step 1

Find the 10 biggest European countries with population greater than 18 million in 2022. To do this, we need the `big_gapminder_dataset` loaded in Section

```{r}
#| class-output: output

europe_big <- big_gapminder_dataset %>%
  filter(year == 2022) %>%
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
  filter(pop > 18000000) %>%
  select(country, pop)

europe_big %>%
  arrange(desc(pop))
```

#### Step 2

Make a dataset that just includes these countries and the ASEAN countries, and only includes data for 1962 and 2022. Create a column `group` that is "ASEAN" for the ASEAN countries and "Europe" for the European countries

```{r}
#| class-output: output
asean_and_europe <- lifeExp_since_1900 %>%
  filter(asean == T | country %in% europe_big$country) %>%
  mutate(group = ifelse(asean==T, "ASEAN", "Europe")) %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1962, 2022))
asean_and_europe
```

#### Step 3

Make a dataset just with the 1962 data, and arrange the countries in order of life expectancy.

```{r}
#| class-output: output
life_exp_1962 <- asean_and_europe %>%
  filter(year == 1962) %>%
  arrange(lifeExp)
life_exp_1962
```

#### Step 4

Make a scatterplot of the 1962 life expectancy data, using the x-axis to separate the ASEAN countries and European countries:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
plot_1962 <- life_exp_1962 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=group, y=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(col = "dodgerblue", size = 2, alpha = 0.5)
plot_1962
```

#### Step 5

Add some country names:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
# Make a vector of distances to shift the country names left and right
# (so they don't appear on top of the blue dots).
shift_text <- rep(c(-0.25,0.25), 10)
shift_text
# Add the text to the plot we made in Step 4 above. 
# I found instructions on how to shift the text at
# https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/position_nudge.html
plot_1962 +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), 
            position = position_nudge(x = shift_text))
```

#### Step 6

Use an unpaired t-test to test the hypothesis that life expectancy in 1962 was higher in the European countries than the ASEAN countries:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
t.test(lifeExp ~ group, data = life_exp_1962)
```

#### Repeat the same steps with 2022 life expectancy data

```{r}
#| class-output: output
lifeExp_2022 <- asean_and_europe %>% 
  filter(year == 2022) %>%
  arrange(lifeExp)

lifeExp_2022 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=group, y=lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point(col = "dodgerblue", size = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), 
            position = position_nudge(x = shift_text))

t.test(lifeExp ~ group, data = lifeExp_2022)
```

### Chi-square test

Here are commands to make a two-by-two table showing numbers of countries in Asia and Europe with life expectancies above and below 60 in 1962.

```{r}
#| class-output: output
life_exp_1962 <- lifeExp_since_1900 %>%
  filter(year == 1962) %>%
  filter(continent %in% c("Asia", "Europe")) %>%
  mutate(lifeExpCat = ifelse(lifeExp < 60, "le < 60", "le >= 60"))

tab_1962 <- table(life_exp_1962$lifeExpCat, life_exp_1962$continent)
tab_1962
```

Once we have created the table, we can use the `chi.sq()` command to run a chi-square test:

```{r}
#| class-output: output
chisq.test(tab_1962)
```

The small p-value indicates that, in 1962, there was a significant difference between

-   the proportion of Asian countries with life expectancy less than 60 ($\frac{34}{34+25} = 58\%$), and
-   the proportion of European countries with life expectancy less than 60 ($\frac{5}{5+43} = 10\%$).

## Exercise

Modify the code above to make a table showing numbers of Asian and European countries with life expectancy above and below 75. Then run a chi-square test to assess the signficance of the difference in proportions.

  filter(continent %in% c("Asia", "Europe")) %>%
  mutate(lifeExpCat = ifelse(lifeExp < 75, "le < 75", "le >= 75"))

tab_2022 <- table(life_exp_2022$lifeExpCat, life_exp_2022$continent)
tab_2022

chisq.test(tab_2022)
```
