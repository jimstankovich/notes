Bang Pho is the name of an intersection and a train station near where I live. According to the dictionary [here](http://sealang.net/thai/):

- *Bang* (written บาง in Thai) means "locality along a waterway". This is like the "Bang" in Bangkok, and Bangkok is full of places next to waterways, for example Bang Sue, Bang Khae, Bang Kapi, and Bang Rak. 
- *Pho* (โพ) is a bo/bodhi/pipal tree, a type of fig tree ([*ficus religiosa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_religiosa)). "Pho" is pronounced like the start of "post", not like the famous soup from Vietnam.
